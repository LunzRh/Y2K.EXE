# Info 📕

Y2K.exe is my first GDI-Trojan developed for Windows XP. 

I spend 16 days working on it and for my first Malware, i like it very much.


# Execution ⚙️

* If you execute the malware, he only blocks Task Manager, Cmd, Win + R and you cannot Shutdown and Log Off the computer. You can use registry, so you know what do...

* But if the malware was executed in the day January 1, 2000 the payloads will start. Relax and wait...

* EasterEgg in January 2, 2000 🤡


# Warning ☣️

Please, don't use this software for malicious purposes. My objective is ONLY study Bytebeats and GDI.
