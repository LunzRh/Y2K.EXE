Y2K.exe is my first Malware and i developed for Windows XP.

I spend 16 days working on it and for my first Malware, i like it very much.


# Execution Tips ⚙️

* Normal execution: Task Manager, Cmd, Win + R, Shutdown and Log Off will be blocked.

* January 2, 2000: Easter Egg 🤡.


# Warning ☣️

I'm not responsible for what you will do with this software.

If your PC explodes in your front resulting on a nuclear war that will destroy the planet, i will not care 👍

# Enjoy ...
